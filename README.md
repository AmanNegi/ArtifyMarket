Welcome to FreshNest, an online marketplace that connects local vegetable sellers and farmers directly with customers who are seeking **fresh and nutritious produce**. We believe in fostering a direct connection between producers and consumers, empowering local communities, and promoting sustainable farming practices.

With FreshNest, you can explore a wide range of locally grown vegetables, sourced directly from farmers in your area. By eliminating intermediaries, we ensure that you receive the freshest and highest-quality produce while supporting local farmers and their livelihoods.

## Why Choose FreshNest? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- **Farm-to-Table Freshness**: At FreshNest, we prioritize freshness above all. Our vegetables are harvested at the peak of ripeness and delivered directly from the farm to your doorstep, guaranteeing maximum flavor and nutrition.

- **Wide Variety**: Discover a diverse selection of vegetables from different farms, enabling you to explore new flavors, try unique heirloom varieties, and add excitement to your culinary creations.
- **Transparency and Traceability**: We believe in transparency and provide detailed information about the farmers, their cultivation methods, and the region where the vegetables are grown. This enables you to make informed choices and connect with the source of your food.
- **Shop Local with Confidence**: Effortlessly discover farms and vendors in your area. FreshNest uses your location to connect you with nearby producers, ensuring you get the freshest produce with minimal travel time.

## How we built it? ü§∑

To deliver a user-friendly web interface, the project uses a Node.js & Express.js backend for server-side operations, while the frontend utilizes React & TailwindCSS. A mobile client was developed using Flutter for greater accessibility.

The application caters to two types of users: customers and farmers. Farmers can add products, upload images of their farms, and manage their listings, while customers can view products, add items to their cart, locate nearby farms on a map, and leave comments on products. Additionally, an admin view is available to manage and moderate content within the application.

The project is maintained to industry standards, with separate branches for different tasks, comprehensive documentation, and beginner-friendly issues to give newcomers hands-on experience with the frameworks (Flutter/Express/ReactJS). For deployment, we evaluated several platforms and chose [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for the website and [Adaptable.io](https://adaptable.io) for the backend.

## License üõ°Ô∏è

> We believe the AGPLv3 best supports our commitment to open-source development and fosters a collaborative atmosphere where everyone can contribute and benefit from the project's growth.

Distributed under the AGPLv3 License. See [`LICENSE.md`](./LICENSE) for more information.

We've chosen to license this project under the **GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPLv3)** to promote open-source development and collaboration. Here are the key reasons for this decision:

- **Strong Copyleft**: The AGPLv3 ensures that derivative works (modified versions) of our code also remain open-source. This means anyone who distributes a modified version over a network (like our backend, frontend, or mobile app) must make the corresponding source code available under the same AGPLv3 license. This fosters a collaborative environment and prevents users from creating closed-source derivatives from our open-source work.
- **Open Source for Everyone**: The AGPLv3 guarantees that not only our code, but also significant modifications to it, remain open and accessible to everyone. This transparency and collaborative spirit are essential for open-source projects.
- **Network Compatibility**: Since our project involves components that communicate over a network (backend, frontend, mobile client), the AGPLv3 is particularly fitting. It specifically addresses network-based interactions, ensuring that modifications made to these network-facing parts are also open-source.
